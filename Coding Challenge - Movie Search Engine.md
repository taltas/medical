You can use the Movie DB API to get movie data. Here’s an API key you can use: a99cc60fc2b34dbb18cb806b8a88ed14

The backend should fetch the data from the Movie DB API. Your frontend and backend can talk to each other through any interface you want (eg, REST, GraphQL, …).
 
The user can type in some text and the search engine will display a list of matching movies including the poster image.
